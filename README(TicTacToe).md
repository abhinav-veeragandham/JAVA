The TicTacToe program is based on Java.

A Tic-Tac-Toe game is originally a paper-pen game or a board game played between two players.
One of them selects any of the markings (usually ‘X’ and ‘O’). There will be a table consisting nine cells.
Each player must place their marking on the cell of their choice. Once a mark is placed on a cell, the respective cell cannot be marked by the other player.
So, the players can counter against each of them by blocking the opponent’s way. And the winner is declared by the player makes (which are three cells) a row, column or diagonal.
